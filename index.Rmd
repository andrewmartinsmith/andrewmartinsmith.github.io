## This is my website

Welcome to my website and enjoy the content.

I am currently making this website in my Data Science 1 class with Dr. Arnholt and am a beginner with all things R, but I am slowly becoming more accustomed with these things.

As I become more well rounded with this programmingmy webpage will get better..
